# MailPilot (one of my better projects...)

AI email writer and translator built into Gmail.

## Overview

MailPilot is a Chrome extension that helps you write better emails faster. It lives in your Gmail taskbar and uses AI to rewrite, rephrase, and improve your emails with just one simple click.

## Features

-   ✨ **AI-Powered Rewriting** - Rewrites any Gmail draft or opened email directly in a built-in side panel
-   🎯 **Multiple Tones** - Choose from options: Formal, Casual, Professional, or Friendly tones
-   🌍 **Translation Support** - Translate emails from and into 15+ language choices
-   ⚡ **Fast & Easy** - One-click rewrite and apply functionality
-   📧 **Gmail Integration** - Seamlessly integrated into Gmail's (and SOON a lot more email websites') compose window

## Installation

Download MailPilot from the Chrome Web Store:

**[Download MailPilot](https://bit.ly/tobiasmailpilot)**

## How It Works

1. Click the MailPilot icon that appears next to Gmail's formatting toolbar
2. MailPilot captures your current subject and body, then generates a polished rewrite
3. One more click applies the new subject and body back into your Gmail compose window
4. Customize the tone and translation to whatever you like

## Perfect For

-   Students and professionals who need clear, respectful email copy fast
-   Multilingual users who want help drafting emails in another language
-   Anyone who writes a lot of email and wants a faster way to "sound better" without overthinking every sentence
